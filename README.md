# twoPhotonXOP
Igor Pro XOP supports twoPhoton program
C++ code for an Igor Pro XOP that supports the twoPhoton program for scanning laser microscope control and data acquisition. Moved into its own repository so you don't have to download all the C++ stuff to use the XOP. The compiled libraries will still be available in the twoPhoton repository.

MacOS version made with XOP toolkit version 8.02 for Igor Pro 8 or above, 64 bit version only. Windows version made with XOP toolket version 7.03 for Igor Pro 6.2 or later. Both 32 bit and 64 bit versions are available.

An Igor Pro help file, twoPhotonXOP.ihf, describes the functionality provided by the XOP.
